# Connecting-Greece

This is the GitHub repository for the Digital Humanities project "Connecting Greece" or CoG done by Susan Crane 
and Zo√© Elise Thomas. To look at our mapping code, you can open CoG-map-code. This code is designed to run
through R Studio Cloud. It relies on two .csv files, inscription_database_Rcompat.csv and latlongcoords.csv.
BOTH FILES ARE REQUIRED FOR THE CODE TO WORK. You can download both .csv files from this GitHub repository.
