# Connecting-Greece

This is the GitHub repository for the Digital Humanities project "Connecting Greece" or CoG done by Susan Crane 
and Zo√© Elise Thomas.

# CoG-map-code
This is our mapping code, designed to run through R Studio Cloud. It relies on two .csv files, inscription_database_Rcompat.csv and latlongcoords.csv.
BOTH FILES ARE REQUIRED FOR THE CODE TO WORK. You can download both .csv files from this GitHub repository.

# inscription_database_Rcompat.csv
This is a sampler of our collected data for the proof of concept.

# latlongcoords.csv
This is a secondary data set based on inscription_database_Rcompat.csv which allows for the drawing of 
segmented lines within RStudio Cloud using leaflet, instead of leaflet's default continuous line.
